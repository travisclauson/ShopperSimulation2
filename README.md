Authors: Travis Clauson, Matthias Sheutz, Tufts CS Department, others

Summary: This is a coding assignment for 'CS-139 Ethics of AI' at Tufts University taught by Professor Matthias Scheutz. This library is a Supermarket Shoppping Simulation developed by the Tufts Computer Science Department. It allows for control from keyboard input or from a programmed autonomous agent. My partner Lidi Yafei and I wrote 'Agent.java' which is an autonomous agent that is capable of navigating its environoment, shopping for its list of items, and paying, all while following most basic shopping norms.
